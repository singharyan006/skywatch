# skywatch
A clean and simple weather forecast app built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can search for any location, toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and view live weather data powered by the Visual Crossing API. The UI adapts to the weather conditions, optionally enhanced with relevant gifs from the Giphy API.
